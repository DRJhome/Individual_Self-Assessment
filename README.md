# Individual_Self-Assessment
## Self Assesment
  During the process of working on the team project I found myself dealing with a lot of conversations in my head. I was in my head thinking how can I work on this project with so many assignments still needing to be completed. Will I even graduate, am I going to mess up the project for the team, and how much work is this going to be? I knew I just needed to put all of those questions to the side and focus on what is there to do. None of thos questions would be able to help me. 
 
### Assignments for the project:
  During the project the tasks I worked on just flowed with what was necessary at the time. When we first started we talked about the project and broke down elements that would be critical for the project of predicting Pitchers salaries using stats. Then the team went to work trying to find databases to get these stats from multiple sources. We discovered a few great places for the data we needed. We had two people in our team start working on the database and put together the data in a CSV file. I was taked with another team member to work on a website together. We both took on using the bellybutton website we built as a base to start. I was transferring the data from the csv to JSON. We then decided that one of us should take on the Tableau aspect of the job. My partner wanted to really work on the website, and I was happy to take on Tableau. I learned alot about Tableau from this assignment like how to set up a racing bar chart, How to format the sheets for the colors we were using for the presentation. 
  
### Team Assessment
  Working with the team was a great experience. There was not anyone trying to be the alpha leader, it was truly a team. We were really able to just stand for everyone getting the help and support they need. We set up a group chat in slack, that we all used to keep the team updated. we were constantly in communication and had numerous meetings using Zoom when outside of class time. The willingness to work like we did was clearly the strength of this group. 
   
### Project Summary
  We took on a project to predict pitchers salaries in the future. We used multiple types of machine learning to determine what factors really determined the salary. We were able to put together a database, website, created visuals using Tableau, and used multiple machine learning tools. Our model didn't work, but we now know what items we should have reviewed and also factors like inflation of salaries over the years. The project was not a success, and we know what would make it work if we had more time. I feel like it was a success, we were able to speak to the data, and accomplished a lot. We built an interactive webpage, a database, multiple pages in Tableau including a racing bar chart.
